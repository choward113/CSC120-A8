- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My class represents a kitten that can fly, walk, rest, grow, grab, drop and examine items. I had the shrink method print a statement saying that it won't work. 
The undo method gave me some trouble since I wasn't sure how to record both the last action and if the action was reversible or not. I tried using a hashtable, using the key as the name of the last action and a boolean value to represent if the action was reversible, but in the end I thought that was overly complicated. So, I just made a string to store the name of the last used method and a boolean variable to store if it was reversible.
